README for hksc-injected

This is a command-line program that I use for generating expect-files
used in testing compiler output. It works by injecting a DLL into a
target process which contains Havok Script compiler machinery in its
image. Make sure the target process is running before calling the
frontend program. The following games are supported:

- Call of Duty: Black Ops II
- Call of Duty: Black Ops III
- Sekiro

Build by running `make.bat'. The script requires Visual C++ tools to be
installed on the machine.
